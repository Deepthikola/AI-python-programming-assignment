Artificial intelligence is transforming the world.  
It powers recommendation systems, fraud detection, and autonomous vehicles.  
However, AI also raises concerns about bias, fairness, and transparency.  

Machine learning is a subset of AI.  
It enables systems to learn patterns from data rather than being explicitly programmed.  
Deep learning, a branch of machine learning, uses neural networks with many layers.  

AI is not only about technology.  
It also involves ethics, regulation, and human values.  
The future of AI depends on how responsibly we design and deploy these systems.
